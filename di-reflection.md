Reflection on digital identities 

This essay aims to reflect on my understanding of. 

digital identities in general 

my digital identities in the past/present 

my digital identities in the future 

To do so I have explored White and Le Cornu’s (2011) Visitor and Resident (V&R) typology which states that digital identities can be categorized as a continuum with visitor on one side and resident modes on the other. Visitor referring to the state of observing online content without inputting or producing personal information that others can view. Resident refers to interacting with other people online through posting content. This distinction is useful as it allows digital engagement to be mapped on a V&R Map, this simplifies and yet informs the reader of someone's digital identity, allowing for reflection and introspection.

To clarify, In 

My visiting mode, the primary activities are using two Google services, Google Maps to find my way around and YouTube for entertainment and news. Moodle to view content needed for University and Emails to check professional and personal information received. 

My resident mode, primary activities are using WhatsApp, to communicate with friends, family and colleagues, GitHub to post updates and work for university, Zoom to communicate and interact with others in a professional setting and LinkedIn to cultivate a professional and academic identity. 

My future digital identity

To further develop my digital identities, I have 

Read research (Steers, M.-L. N., et al., 2014) on the happiness and mental health of social media users, finding that long term usage, especially for young people is associated with worse mental health and wellbeing. 

Removed social media apps used in the past such as Instagram and Snapchat, due to low usage and perceived as unnecessary use of time 

Talked to friends and family about the pros and cons of certain identities, finding that a common theme was using social media for self-validation rather than due to a genuine interest in sharing more about myself. 

Used a SWOT (CIPD, 2020) analysis to understand how to improve my future engagement online. Outcomes involved seeing that there are more weaknesses than strengths when it comes to my current amount of YouTube usage. There are more professional opportunities if I start networking on LinkedIn. 

Used secure passwords and installed new antivirus to improve security 

After identifying and analysing my current use of digital identities on the Web, I set the goal to decrease my usage of YouTube as the targeted advertising keeps me clicking on more videos distracting me from other tasks. 

To achieve this goal, I plan to  

Use YouTube in incognito browsing, making it, so I must manually search for videos to watch as there will not be targeted recommendations on the front page. 

Turn off notifications so that when someone I am subscribed to uploads a video, I am not distracted. 

When casually viewing YouTube, I could limit my usage to a specific number of videos or set time limit through using the settings and digital wellbeing function on Android. 

Further reflections 

To further reflect on my digital identities, I would like to answer the following questions 

What implications do my visitor identities have on my personal life? 

What does it mean to critically evaluate information i.e., what is critical thinking? 

On the V&R map, what is the fundamental difference between 'visitor' modes and 'resident' modes, and what does the 'personal on institutional' dimension provide? 

Firstly, my visitor identities have profound implications on my personal life as they access information for my entertainment and professional development. My visitor identities have shaped the way I think about things as the amount of knowledge available allows me to develop who I am as a person, for example I found out what type of music and humour I enjoy through browsing the web. 

To answer the second question, to critically evaluate information, it is important to make sure where the information is coming from. For example, if information comes from a blog, it is less likely to be reliable compared to a journal as it is unlikely for an individual blogger to have information that academics have not previously considered. Critical thinking can be defined as the ability to comprehend and evaluate information regarding accuracy. When it comes to evaluating information from the news, it is critical to read beyond the headline as the headline often is sensationalized at the expense of a holistic understanding of an issue, so reading entire articles and comparing the information to other sources of information should allow someone to be informed enough to feel confident in having critically evaluated information. 

Lastly, on the V&R map the fundamental difference between visitor and resident modes is that in the visitor mode no personal information is being posted, instead information is viewed. Whereas in the resident mode, the user is actively involved in posting information about themselves, such as for example on Instagram or Facebook. The personal and institutional dimension provides insight into how these different modes can be applied to someone's personal and professional life. This means that more insight can be gained as someone can be in resident mode in their personal life however when within their institutional digital identity, they start to be wary of sharing their opinion or personal information about themselves and become more of a visitor. 

To conclude, I have outlined my current digital identity and evaluated its current state. I further developed my digital identities by reading research, talking to friends and family, doing a SWOT analysis and by making sure that my passwords are secure. I make concrete steps on developing my digital identity through aiming to decrease my usage of YouTube. Lastly, I reflected my digital identities by answering questions considered relevant.
